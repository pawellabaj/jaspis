## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

##Caveat

Snap! runs like molasses on the RPi. Don't do that. Until the performance issues are solved, you can run Snap! from a server on the Pi (I use lighttpd) and access it from a more powerful computer on your network. Or just connect to the official implementation at Berkeley: http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html
